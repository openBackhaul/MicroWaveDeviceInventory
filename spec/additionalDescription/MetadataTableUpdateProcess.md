# Metadata Table Update Process

This page describes the process for updating the MWDI metadata table kept in the ElasticSearch database.  
It also describes the related profileInstances and their usage.

The metadata table is not to be confused with the MWDI's deviceList.  
- deviceList: stores only the list of currently connected devices and is used as base for retrieving device controlConstructs periodically
  - is updated according to periodic syncs with the controller
  - and through notifications about controller status changes
- metadata table: stores all devices from the controller with their connection status and additional metadata.  
  - is also update according to the deviceList periodic syncs with the controller,
  - but in addition has also an own periodic sync,
  - as well as being updated due to the controller status notifications

The following picture outlines the differences between both shortly:

## Relevant profileInstances

The profileInstances directly relevant to the metadata table are connectionStatusSyncPeriod and metadataTableRetentionPeriod.  

**`connectionStatusSyncPeriod`**
- The connection-status of all devices mounted on the controller is retrieved periodically according to the time interval specified here.
- Under normal conditions, the MWDI should receive notifications from NotificationProxy about devices changing their connection status, however notifications may be lost (e.g. due to connection errors). Therefore, a periodic sync is executed.
- After each connectionStatusSyncPeriod hours the current metadata table entries are compared against the Controller information and updated accordingly.

**`metadataTableRetentionPeriod`**
- **The retention period determines how long devices are kept in the metadata table after they have changed into a disconnected state (i.e. connecting or unable-to-connect).**
- Each time a periodic metadata table sync is executed, all devices with connection-status!=connected in the table are checked for their retention. If the duration between the current timestamp and the changed-to-disconnected-time (in days) exceeds the configured retention period, the device is deleted from the metadata table. Otherwise it is kept in the table.

## Metadata table contents

The table shall contain the following columns:

- **mount-name**:
  - the device name
  - primary key
- **connection-status**: 
  - connection status on the controller
  - connected, connecting or unable-to-connect
- **changed-to-disconnected-time**: 
  - Indicates when the device changed (the last time) from connected state into not being connected anymore
  - Initially null; if a device changes back to connected, the timestamp is again reset to null
- **added-to-device-list-time**: 
  - the time, when the device has been initially added to the MWDIâ€˜s deviceList
  - If a device goes into connecting or unable-to-connect state, the timestamp is set to null, as the device shall be removed from the deviceList
- **last-complete-control-construct-update-time**:
  - the last time, the CC has been updated completely (i.e. periodic or initial retrieval)
  - If the device is no longer connected, the timestamp is set to null
- **last-control-construct-notification-update-time**:
  - the last time, the CC has been updated due to a received notification (object creation/deletion or attribute value change)
  - If the device is no longer connected, the timestamp is set to null
- **number-of-partial-updates-since-last-complete-update**:
  - The number of updates caused by received notifications (object creation/deletion or attribute value change), since the CC has been updated completely the last time (i.e. since timestamp-last-complete-control-construct-update)
  - Once a complete CC update happens, the counter is reset to 0
  - If the device is no longer connected, the counter is also set to 0 
- **schema-cache-directory**:
  - This attribute contains information about the schema cache directory applied to the device at the controller
  - It indicates the device vendor, and partially also the device type.

## Building and updating the metadata table

The following picture aims at providing an overview about how the metadata table is updated.  

As can be seen, the metadata table is updated due to
- deviceList updates according to the periodic deviceList sync (pink),
- periodic connection-status sync with the controller (green)
- or when there are changes to a controlConstruct  
  - from either the periodic complete controlConstruct retrieval,
  - or triggered by notifications
  - _note: the controlConstruct can also be updated by calling live paths on the MWDI. This, however, is ignored for the metadata table update currently._

Also note that an attribute being _null_ shall be represented by an empty string.

## Filtering of metadata

The service /v1/provide-device-status-metadata requires a list of device names, for which the metadata shall be returned, to be provided in the requestBody.  
Listed device names, for which no data could be found in the metadata table, are ignored.

put testcase stuff here, 
first only add tests (requests) for 
- services with domain=cache
- response 460 (invalid mountName)

(In Postman collection maybe create an own folder for 460 response Code and one for 470)

two scenarios to test, examples:
a) /core-model-1-4:network-control-domain=cache/control-construct={mountName}
b) /core-model-1-4:network-control-domain=cache/control-construct={mountName}/equipment={uuid}/actual-equipment

Test 1: provide invalid mountName ("dummyMountName"): expected is 460 response
 - both a and b will return 460, if for b an invalid uuid parameter is provided that does not matter

Test 2: provide valid mountName, but invalid other parameters: expected is 470 response
 - a can be skipped, there are no additional parameters -> don't create a request for this service
 - b: the mountName is known, but the remaining path is invalid, here the uuid does matter => 470
